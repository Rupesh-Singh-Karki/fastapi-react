## 🐳 Running with Docker

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Step-by-Step

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/minimart-manager.git
cd minimart-manager
````

2. **Create `.env` file** in root (same level as `docker-compose.yml`) and add the following:

```
DB_URI=postgres://myuser:mypassword@db:5432/karkibase
EMAIL=youremail@gmail.com
PASS=your-email-app-password
```

> 🔐 **Note**: `EMAIL` and `PASS` are required for sending email notifications to suppliers. Use an app-specific password if using Gmail.

3. **Build & Start Containers**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:

* Start PostgreSQL on port `5432`
* Start the backend API on `http://localhost:8000`

4. **(Optional) Push updated backend image to Docker Hub**

```bash
docker build -t rupesh69/minimart-api:v1 .
docker push rupesh69/minimart-api:v1
```
